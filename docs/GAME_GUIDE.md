## Introduction

**Stay Caffeinated** is a strategic caffeine management game where you play as a developer trying to survive a full workday by maintaining optimal caffeine levels. Balance your energy to avoid both passing out from exhaustion and exploding from overcaffeination!

### The Challenge
- **Survive an 8-hour workday** (compressed into exciting gameplay minutes)
- **Maintain optimal caffeine levels** (60-80% - the "Golden Zone")
- **Handle work events** that drain your energy
- **Score points** by staying productive

## Getting Started

### Quick Start
1. **Select Difficulty**: Choose from Intern to Founder level
2. **Start Your Day**: Click "Start Game" to begin your workday

## Core Mechanics

### Caffeine System

#### Caffeine Levels
- **0-30%**: ⚠️ **Danger Zone** - Risk of passing out
- **30-60%**: 🟡 **Sub-optimal** - Reduced productivity
- **60-80%**: ✅ **Optimal Zone** - Maximum productivity & points
- **80-90%**: 🟡 **Over-caffeinated** - Jittery, reduced control
- **90-100%**: ⚠️ **Critical** - Risk of explosion

#### Natural Depletion
- Caffeine naturally decreases over time
- Rate increases with higher difficulty
- Events can accelerate depletion
- Crashes after energy drinks increase depletion

### Health System
- Starts at 100% each day
- Decreases when outside optimal caffeine range
- Critical health triggers visual warnings
- Reaching 0% health ends the game

### Time Progression
- Game time moves faster than real time
- 8-hour workday condensed into minutes
- Time speed varies by difficulty
- Events occur at specific times

### The "Emergency Protocol"
For when things go wrong:
1. Below 30%: Energy Drink immediately

3. Maintain 75% exactly
4. Perfect event timing
5. No mistakes allowed!

## Remember

> "The key to staying caffeinated is not maximum caffeine, but optimal caffeine. Like real development, it's a marathon, not a sprint!"

Good luck, and may your caffeine levels be ever optimal! ☕🎮
