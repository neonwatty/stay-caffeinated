## Gameplay Questions

### How do I win the game?
Success is surviving the entire workday (9 AM to 5 PM game time) without:
- Passing out (0% caffeine)
- Exploding (>100% caffeine)
- Health crisis (0% health)

Your score reflects how well you maintained optimal caffeine levels throughout the day.

### What's the optimal caffeine range?
The optimal zone is **60-80% caffeine**. Staying in this range:
- Maximizes point generation
- Maintains health
- Builds streak multipliers
- Unlocks achievements

### Why did I suddenly explode/pass out?
Common causes:
- **Explosion**: Consuming high-caffeine drinks when already above 80%
- **Passing out**: Ignoring low caffeine warnings or crash effects
- **Events**: Some events dramatically increase depletion rate

### What's the difference between drinks?
Each drink has unique properties:
- **Tea**: Low boost, minimal crash, quick cooldown
- **Coffee**: Moderate boost, moderate crash, balanced
- **Energy Drink**: Massive boost, severe crash, long cooldown
- **Espresso**: High boost, notable crash, medium cooldown
- **Water**: No caffeine, stabilizes levels, shortest cooldown

### How do events work?
Events are workplace challenges that occur at set times:
- **Warning appears** 30 seconds before
- **Effects vary**: increased depletion, drink restrictions, etc.
- **Preparation is key**: boost caffeine before events start
- **Score multipliers** available during events

### What are power-ups?
Power-ups are special items that occasionally appear:
- Click to collect them
- Provide temporary benefits
- Examples: slow time, double points, damage shield
- Strategic use can dramatically improve scores

### Why is my health decreasing?
Health decreases when:
- Caffeine is below 30% (exhaustion)
- Caffeine is above 90% (overcaffeination)
- You're experiencing a severe crash
- Certain events cause health damage

### What do the visual effects mean?
- **Screen shake**: High caffeine or crashes
- **Blur**: Low caffeine or poor health
- **Red edges**: Critical health warning
- **Particle effects**: Optimal zone or power-ups
- All effects can be disabled in settings
