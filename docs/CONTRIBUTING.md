## üé® Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Style Guide

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Enable strict mode
- Define explicit types (avoid `any`)
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Use enums for constants
- Document complex types

```typescript
// Good
interface GameState {
  score: number;
  level: Difficulty;
  isPlaying: boolean;
}

// Bad
const gameState: any = {
  score: 0,
  level: 'easy',
  isPlaying: false
};
```

### React/Component Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic to custom hooks
- Use proper prop types
- Implement error boundaries where appropriate

```tsx
// Good
const GameButton: React.FC<GameButtonProps> = ({ onClick, children, disabled }) => {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={onClick}
      disabled={disabled}
      className="game-button"
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

### CSS/Styling Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Keep custom CSS to a minimum
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Ensure dark mode compatibility
- Maintain consistent spacing

```tsx
// Good
<div className="flex items-center justify-between p-4 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800">

// Avoid
<div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center' }}>
```

### Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain > 80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases
- Mock external dependencies

```typescript
// Good test name
describe('CaffeineBar', () => {
  it('should display warning when caffeine level drops below 20%', () => {
    // test implementation
  });
});
```
